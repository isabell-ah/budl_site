To create an automatic carousel of images in a React app, you can follow the steps below:

First, you need to import the necessary libraries for creating a carousel. In this case, we will be using 
react-bootstrap
 and 
react-icons
.
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Carousel, Image } from 'react-bootstrap';
import { FaChevronLeft, FaChevronRight } from 'react-icons/fa';
Define an array of objects that contains information about the images such as the source (
src
) and the alt text (
alt
). This data could come from an API endpoint or a database, but for simplicity, we will hardcode it here.
const images = [
  {
    id: 1,
    src: '/images/image1.jpg',
    alt: 'First image',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    src: '/images/image2.jpg',
    alt: 'Second image',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    src: '/images/image3.jpg',
    alt: 'Third image',
  },
];
Define a state variable that keeps track of the currently selected image index.
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
Define event handlers for clicking on the previous and next buttons. These event handlers should update the 
index
 state variable accordingly.
const handlePrevClick = () => {
  if (index === 0) {
    setIndex(images.length - 1);
  } else {
    setIndex(index - 1);
  }
};

const handleNextClick = () => {
